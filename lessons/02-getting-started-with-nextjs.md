# Introduction to Next.js: Getting Started

## What is Next.js

Next.js is a React-based framework for building hybrid applications. It enables you to create anything from static websites to fully dynamic web apps at scaleâ€”or any combination of the two. Built and maintained by Vercel, Next.js comes packed with a set of simple, opinionated conventions designed to streamline development and make sophisticated React features easier to adopt.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started: Setting up your Development Environment

Let's get your development environment ready! Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Install Node.js 20+:**

   - Ensure you have Node.js version 20 or higher installed. You can check your version by running `node -v` in your terminal.
   - If you need to install or upgrade Node.js, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git. Replace `[repo]` with the actual repository URL provided for this lesson.
     ```bash
     git clone [repo]
     cd [your-repo-name]
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Navigate into the cloned repository directory in your terminal.
   - Install project dependencies using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     or the shorthand:
     ```bash
     npm i
     ```
4. **Start Development Server (Optional):**
   - While not strictly necessary for setup, you can start the development server to verify everything is working:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
     Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

  # Project Structure and Configuration

## Next.js App Directory Structure

Next.js 13+ introduced the App Router with a new `app/` directory structure. Let's explore the file and folder organization in a Next.js project:

> **Important Note**: Next.js only enforces conventions for the `app/`, `public/`, and `api/` directories. Everything else is up to you.

### Next.js Enforced Conventions

- **`app/`**: The main directory for your application code using the App Router

  - **`page.tsx`**: Defines the UI for a route
  - **`layout.tsx`**: A shared wrapper for that route and its child routes (like a common header/footer).
  - **`loading.tsx`**: Loading UI for a segment, i.e, the UI to show when a page is loading.
  - **`error.tsx`**: Error handling UI for a segment, i.e, The UI to show when thereâ€™s an error in a page.
  - **`not-found.tsx`**: 404 UI for a segment, i.e, when something is not found. 

- **`app/api/`**: API routes for creating endpoints

  - Example: `app/api/users/route.ts`

- **`public/`**: Static assets like images, fonts, and files
  - Served at the root path (e.g., `/logo.svg`)
  - Not processed by the build system

### Common Organizational Patterns (Not Enforced)

**Not enforced**, but developers often use them for better organization.


- **Component Organization**

  - `app/components/`: Reusable UI pieces (buttons, cards, navbars).
  - `app/ui/`:  Basic UI elements (like smaller building blocks).

- **Route Organization**

  - `app/(group)/`: Route groups for organizational purposes (doesn't affect URL)

- **Other Common Folders**
  - `app/lib/` or `lib/`: Utility functions and shared code
  - `app/styles/`: CSS files for components/pages.
  - `app/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (reusable logic).
  - `app/context/`: React context providers
  - `app/types/` or `types/`: TypeScript type definitions

### File Placement Flexibility

Next.js gives you freedom in where you place most files. For example:

- You can put components anywhere â€” inside routes or in a common folder.

- You can keep styles with the component or in a central styles folder.

- You can keep utilities near where they are used or in a shared folder.

## Summary

Next.js only cares about:

1. **`app/`**: For App Router pages and routing
2. **`public/`**: For static assets
3. **`app/api/`**: For API routes

Everything elseâ€”how you organize components, utilities, styles, and other codeâ€”is entirely up to you. Choose a structure that makes sense for your project and team.
